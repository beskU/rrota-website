## Phase 1 – Foundation & Transparency

Initial focus areas:

- Contract deployment on Solana
- Public verification of token data
- Liquidity setup
- Community infrastructure
- On-chain transparency systems

This phase ensures structural stability before expansion.

---

## Phase 2 – Spin-to-Win Utility

One of RROTA’s core ecosystem components is the **Spin-to-Win reward utility**.

Objective:

- Reward real holders
- Reduce farming abuse
- Integrate anti-bot logic
- Connect rewards to verified wallets

The system focuses on controlled reward distribution rather than unsustainable token emissions.

---

## Phase 3 – Telegram WebApp Integration

RROTA is building deeper Telegram integration through:

- WebApp wallet connection
- Holder verification logic
- Controlled participation systems
- Reward-based engagement

Telegram serves as an entry point, not the final product layer.

---

## Phase 4 – Gaming Utility Development

RROTA roadmap includes structured game utility planning.

Planned concept:

- Shooter-style interactive system
- Reward integration logic
- Fair distribution model
- Anti-exploit safeguards

Game mechanics must pass internal stability tests before public rollout.

No rushed releases.

## Phase 5 – Transit / Real-World Utility Research

Long-term ecosystem expansion explores:

- Transit-related integration
- Utility-based reward mechanics
- Real-world use-case development

Research phase focuses on feasibility and technical implementation before announcement.

## Why Structured Phases Matter

Many crypto projects:

- Announce features before building
- Overpromise timelines
- Launch unstable utilities

RROTA’s roadmap is structured around:

- Development first
- Testing second
- Deployment third
- Public announcement last

Execution > hype.

---

## Transparency Commitment

The roadmap is:

- Public
- Structured
- Gradual
- Subject to technical validation
