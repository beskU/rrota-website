# RROTA vs Meme Coins: Why Utility Tokens Outlast Hype Cycles

The crypto market moves in cycles.

Every few months, a new wave of meme coins explodes in popularity. Most rise quickly — and disappear just as fast.

**RROTA coin (RTA token)** was not built for short-term hype. It was structured as a Solana-based utility token focused on ecosystem development and transparent execution.

This article explains the key differences between RROTA and typical meme coins.

## What Is a Meme Coin?

Meme coins are typically:

- Driven by social media trends
- Dependent on viral marketing
- Built around humor or cultural references
- Lacking structured utility
- Highly volatile

While some meme coins achieve temporary popularity, most struggle to maintain long-term value once attention shifts.
