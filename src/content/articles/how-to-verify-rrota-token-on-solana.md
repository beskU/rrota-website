# How to Verify the Official RROTA Token on Solana

In crypto, verification matters.

Fake tokens and phishing websites are common. This guide explains how to verify the **official RROTA (RTA token)** safely.

---

## Step 1 – Confirm the Official Website

The only official domain is:

👉 https://rrota.xyz

Be cautious of similar domains such as:
- rr0ta.xyz (zero instead of letter “o”)
- variations with added words
- domains with unusual extensions

Always double-check the spelling.

## Step 2 – Verify the Contract Address

Official RROTA contract:
3yeWYPG3BvGBFrwjar9e28GBYZgYmHT79d7FBVS6xL1a


Never trust:
- Screenshots
- Random Telegram messages
- Unverified links

Always copy the contract from the official website.

---

## Step 3 – Check on Solscan

Visit:

https://solscan.io/token/3yeWYPG3BvGBFrwjar9e28GBYZgYmHT79d7FBVS6xL1a

Verify:
- Mint status
- Freeze status
- Supply data
- Holder distribution

## Step 4 – Cross-Check on Jupiter

Use Jupiter directly:

If the contract differs, do not proceed.

## Common Red Flags
