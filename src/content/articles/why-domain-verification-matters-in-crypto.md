# Why Domain Verification Matters in Crypto

Phishing websites are one of the most common threats in crypto.

Attackers create domains that look almost identical to official websites.

Example tactics:
- Replacing “o” with “0”
- Adding extra letters
- Changing domain extensions
- Copying content

---

## Why This Is Dangerous

When users connect their wallet to a fake site:

- Funds can be drained
- Permissions can be abused
- Tokens can be stolen

Verification prevents this.

## How to Protect Yourself

1. Bookmark the official domain
2. Double-check spelling
3. Verify contract address
4. Use Solscan or Jupiter directly
5. Never trust DMs with links

---

## Official RROTA Website

The only official domain:

https://rrota.xyz

If the URL differs even slightly, leave immediately.

## Final Thought

In crypto, responsibility is shared.

Projects build transparency.

Users verify before acting.

Stay safe.
